## FAQ

#### If I have Spotify integration on, will it break tuneCord?

No, however Spotify integration will only show when iTunes is paused.

#### Why does it take 15 seconds for songs to update?

Discord limits how often we can send updates.

#### Help! It keeps saying `Error: Could not connect`

This 9/10 times, usually means Discord isn't open.

Make sure you're using the desktop version, not the web site.
